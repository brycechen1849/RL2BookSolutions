# Exercise Solutions

## Introduction 
See the source code on [Github Repo](https://github.com/brycechen1849/RL2BookSolutions), and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me at ***brycechen1849@gmail.com*** .
It serves mainly as a public note for the book and it's still being rapidly updated because I'm, at the same time, trying to get familiar with the RL research area.  

### References
The code implementations references are:

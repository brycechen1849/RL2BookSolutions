# Exercise Solutions

## Introduction 
See the source code on [Github Repo](https://github.com/brycechen1849/RL2BookSolutions), and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me at ***brycechen1849@gmail.com*** .
It serves mainly as a public note for the book and it's still being rapidly updated because I'm, at the same time, trying to get familiar with the RL research area.  

### References
The code implementations references are:

## Solutions

### Chapter 1

Chapter 1 is an introductory one with tic-tac-toe game as an example of the full story. 
It involves more advanced topics of reinforcement learning problem that I would choose to implement the full setting when I finished later chapters.
(Although there is a implementation of the full simulation in tic-tac-toe.py)

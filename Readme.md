### Introduction 
This is a personal notes for the book Reinforcement Learning: A Introduction (By Sutton & Bartol).
These codes (will) include:
+ Solutions to exercise problems
+ The code generating each figure in the book.

###  
The bulk part of the implementation are from:
+ The exercise solutions (However, this part are somewhat outdated because the latest version of the book has covered a lot of new exercises.)https://github.com/LyWangPX/Reinforcement-Learning-2nd-Edition-by-Sutton-Exercise-Solutions
+ The code for Figures: https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction/blob/master/chapter02/ten_armed_testbed.py

###
Again, this serves mainly as a personal note for the book and it's still being updated becuase I'm, at the same time, trying to get familiar with the RL research area.
